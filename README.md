## Wine Recommendation

In this project, two wine recommendation models were developed using the [XWines](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rogerioxavier/x-wines-slim-version) dataset. The approach includes collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation techniques to provide personalized suggestions to users based on their preferences.

The XWines dataset is a comprehensive collection of wine data, including attributes such as grape variety, region, vintage, and user ratings.

## Which recommendations were used?

**Collaborative Filtering:** This model utilizes user-item interactions to recommend wines based on similar users' preferences. By identifying patterns in user behavior, personalized recommendations can be generated for each user.

**Content-based:** In contrast to collaborative filtering, this model focuses on wine attributes such as grape variety, region, and vintage. By understanding each wine's characteristics, we can recommend similar wines based on content similarity.

## Technologies

* **Python:** A versatile programming language widely used in data science, web development, and automation.
* **Numpy and Pandas:** Used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and data manipulation.
* **Jupyter Notebook and VSCode:** Commonly used development environments for Python coding, with Jupyter Notebook focusing on interactive data analysis and VSCode being a general-purpose code editor.
* **Scikit-learn:** A machine learning library offering a variety of algorithms and tools for data analysis.
    * **TfidfVectorizer:** sklearn class that transforms text into numerical representations using the TF-IDF technique.
    * **linear_kernel:** function that calculates linear similarity between two datasets.
    * **cosine_similarity:** function to calculate vector similarity using the cosine measure.
    * **euclidean_distances:** function to calculate Euclidean distance between points in an n-dimensional space.
